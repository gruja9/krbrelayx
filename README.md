# Krbrelayx - Kerberos relaying and unconstrained delegation abuse toolkit

Fork of [dirkjanm](https://github.com/dirkjanm/krbrelayx/), all credits go to him. I just made some minor changes and added a new "manual_modify" action that makes it possible to overwrite the DNS records that we have write rights to, but not read rights. This is normally not possible with the existing "modify" action. The inspiration came from [https://www.akamai.com/blog/security-research/spoofing-dns-by-abusing-dhcp](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security-research/spoofing-dns-by-abusing-dhcp) and the usage of the DNSUpdateProxy domain group.
